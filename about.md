Hei, I am a 25 years old boy (I would say) who have passion for cooking, technology, photography, games and SPORTS.
Yeah I am addicted to sports, if I can marry sports I would but I wouldn’t mind marrying a beautiful woman of my dream either.
I love cooking, I spend quite a lot of time thinking and learning what I am going to cook and of course I enjoy eating (who doesn’t?) So it makes a win-win situation for me.
  Recently I started to have big interest in photography, I think it’s because some of my friends are infecting me with amazing-photos addiction. It must be a chronic addiction liking and trying to get the likes from others!!!
