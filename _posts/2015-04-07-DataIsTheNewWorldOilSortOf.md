title: Data is the new world oil! Sort of.

---



<p1>

I am always fascinated by data and this dates back since I was a little boy.  I realized when I was a little boy that I always had the hunch for combination of words and numbers, and ever since my brain always tries to solve the puzzle I created from words or numbers I see.



Recently I just graduated from one university of applied sciences in Finland and during that time I realized how **HIP** data is. I mean everyone keeps talking about analytics, Big Data, Business Intelligence, search engine optimization and others. The trend might not yet reached its peak but pretty soon I am sure that *we would be running our cars with data* heheh.



Graduating with an Information Technology degree and living in Finland I am certain that I have chosen the right career path, even though till now I have not found the best suitable IT job for me yet but I am sure I will find it soon, **VERY SOON**



Talking about data as the new world oil sounds a little bit too much and often people are misled by data driven attitude. In my opinion everyone should never rely only on data, I know data, information and knowledge never lie but in order to achieve your goals you have to always know what do you want to achieve, why do you want to achieve and how you are going to achieve. Therefore it is always a result driven, with the help of data.



One thing that concerns me with the utilization of data is for example when I am searching for protein shake on Google Search, in just a matter of minutes I would see a protein shake advertisement on my Facebook. I mean how terrifiying that is that someone, somewhere and somewhat is watching your every movement and it is not pretty. 



Oh well, it is just another opinion of mine on another rainy Tuesday. I will write more when something comes in mind. Meanwhile, enjoy your week and for me I have to enjoy my daily routine of searching for jobs, writing cover letters and sending my applications, oh yeah it is cardio day today!
