Finally I got my personal and very own website/blog up and running thanks to my really good friend Ville. Took sometime for me to understand how Ruby, Git and Jekyll work but finally I got it.

It is a cloudy easter day filled with a little bit of hangover but I managed to get many things done.
I realize this blog/website is far from perfect but I am trying to be as productive as possible and having one of your own wouldn't hurt. So sit tight and enjoy the ride because more annoying posts are coming!
