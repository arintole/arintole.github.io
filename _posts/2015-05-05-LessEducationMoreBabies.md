title: Less Education, More Babies?


---
I came across with a short discussion and idea of how less educated countries tend to have more babies than more educated countries. Might be true or might be not. Let's see...

Growing up in Indonesia but raised with both Finnish and Indonesian culture and currently residing in Finland, I have mixed feeling about this matter. As a comparison according to [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2054.html#13) for year 2014 per 1000 population Indonesia has 17,04 births while Finland has 10,35 births. There is not enough data in [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html#139) about Finnish literacy rate but I think it's 100% for age 15 and over, while Indonesia has 92,8% for age 15 and over. This doesn't support my original idea therefore Imma let you finish but I will show you a better understanding of this using Big Data! Oh yeah, sounds cool huh.

Back in 2014 I came across with a beautiful ad by Danish goverment and a travel agency during my Big Data course, it's called Do It for Denmark! <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrO3TfJc9Qw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
The idea is simple, if you make babies during your holiday Danish government would pay for that particular holiday. The video shows how Denmark is struggling with their birth rate, for such country with high education Denmark doesn't have enough birth rate to support their ageing population. I believe this is happening in almost all Nordic countries, including Finland.

With amazing teamwork with my beautiful friends and after blood, sweat and tears were sacrificed we managed to create one sophisticated presentation about this matter.
Here is a short description about our presentation.

<h4>Process Diagrams</h4>

To put it in simple words, we listened to our teacher, we read and discussed, we gathered data and formulated hypothesis, we studied the technical parts, we retrieved data from data sources, we uploaded the data to Hadoop, we merged and choose the right data attributes and finally we created analysis and report in Microsoft BI dashboard.

We created the right relationships and choose the right attributes as follows.

And finally **Drum Roll........**
Tadaaaaa here is our final results

We choose Business Intelligence Dashboard instead of IBM BigInsights Dashboard because we happened to have a Business Intelligence course going on at the very same time and me personally I like the visual in Business Intelligence better than IBM BigInsights. MS BI is more user friendly as most of the functionality derive from MS Excel and also more colors like rainbow!

From the diagram above we can justify that in year 2013 both in Finland and Germany where the enrolment rate to primary school are pretty close to 100%, people tend to have less babies. The number shows that per 1000 people the birth rate in Finland and Germany are about 9, while in average in Mali, Niger and Zambia where the enrolment rate is lower than in Finland and Germany, the birth rate are about higher at 47 per 1000 people.

Finally we can determine that our hypothesis was somehow true however there are many other factors that might affect this such as cultures and religions. I am not going to go any further because those two factors might be too much as I am no expert in those two factors and also I am tired...

I have to save some energy because it's chest day today!
